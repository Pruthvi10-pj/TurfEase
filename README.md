TurfEase is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and digitize the process of booking sports turfs.

Instead of calling turf owners or visiting locations physically, users can view real-time availability, select preferred time slots, and book turfs online with ease.

The application provides a fast and interactive user experience using ReactJS on the frontend. 

The backend is developed using Spring Boot and ASP.NET Core, which handle business logic and ensure secure communication with the database. 

Axios is used for frontend-backend communication, and all APIs are tested using Postman to ensure reliability and correctness.

TurfEase is deployed on AWS, making the application scalable, performant, and accessible online.
