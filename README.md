# TurfEase

TurfEase is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and digitize the process of booking sports turfs.

Instead of calling turf owners or visiting locations physically, users can check real-time turf availability, select preferred time slots, and book turfs online with ease.

The frontend is developed using **ReactJS**, providing a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience.

The backend is implemented using **Spring Boot** and **ASP.NET Core**, handling business logic, secure data processing, and communication with the database.

**Axios** is used for seamless frontend-backend communication, and all REST APIs are thoroughly tested using **Postman** to ensure reliability and correctness.

The application is deployed on **AWS**, making TurfEase scalable, performant, and accessible online.
